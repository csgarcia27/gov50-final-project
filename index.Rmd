## Project thoughts

I am not decided on what I want my project to be. I am very interested in the law and so I think it would be interesting to collect data relating to a topic on that. One idea would be looking into the Supreme Court, specifically, their patterns in decision-making and how that is affected based upon the political makeup of the court. I am still open to other ideas but that is a direction I definitely see myself heading to.
